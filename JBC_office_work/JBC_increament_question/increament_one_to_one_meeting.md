**JBC Increment Question and and:**

1. What you have done in past year and what is the plan / goal of your next year?
2. How rating you give yourself out of 10? Why?
3. What technical you should improve ?

**1.What you have done in past year and what is the plan / goal of your next year?** 

**SRS project ** (initial phase) development both** **

1. POC done
2. AI/ML part (Integrate llm model),
3. project architecture design,
4. Documentation everything in both

**Sevensix**

* Initial phase started with RAG development
* RAG pipeline design
* Based on requirements analysis architecture design
* POC done
* Vector db research ( wivieate, chromadb, milvus,pinecone) Handover to rezoan vai

**Ving+self Investigation**

    1. Requirements analysis**  **and deliver plan to kaiservai then naim vai


**Leather:(currently 80% bandwidth)**

1. Handle overall AI/ML part
2. Build VIT pipeline
3. Data preprocessing
4. Training model build
5. Inferencing setup
6. Make plan for evaluation
7. Accuracy increasing plan through expert feedback






**Next year goal/plan:**

1. Improve my technical skill as much as possible for prepare myself for any kind of incomming project
3. Improve communication skill
4. Learn about system design
5. MCP,ADK,Agentic activity** **
6. Backend learning (Fastapi, Django)


**How rating you give yourself out of 10? Why?** ****

9/10

Because I try to

Technical:

1. Maintain deadline strictly
2. Make documentation for each project assigned to me
3. Maintain backlog strictly
4. Make documentation for each project

Management:

Communication:

1. Need to improve communication skill
2. 















### **Q1. What you have done in past year and what is the plan/goal of your next year?**

**Answer (refined):**

In the past year, I have contributed to multiple projects across different stages – from proof of concept to deployment and documentation:

* **SRS Project**
  * Completed the POC and integrated LLM models.
  * Designed project architecture and full documentation.
  * Contributed both on technical and planning sides.
* **Sevensix Project**
  * Designed and developed the initial RAG pipeline.
  * Conducted requirement analysis and created system architecture.
  * Completed POC and researched multiple vector databases (Weaviate, ChromaDB, Milvus, Pinecone) before handover.
* **Ving + Self Investigation**
  * Conducted requirement analysis and prepared the delivery plan.
* **Leather Project (80% focus)**
  * Leading the AI/ML pipeline.
  * Built ViT-based pipeline for defect detection.
  * Data preprocessing, training, inference setup.
  * Designed evaluation plan and improved accuracy using expert feedback.

**Next Year Goals:**

1. Strengthen technical skills to be ready for any new AI/ML or backend project.
2. Improve communication and presentation skills to collaborate better with stakeholders.
3. Learn **System Design** to contribute more to architecture-level discussions.
4. Explore **MCP, ADK, and Agentic workflows** to align with new AI trends.
5. Gain hands-on expertise in **FastAPI and Django** for backend integration.

### **Q2. How rating you give yourself out of 10? Why?**

**Answer (refined):**

I would rate myself  **9/10** .

**Reasons:**

* **Technical Strengths**
  * Strictly maintain deadlines and deliverables.
  * Always document my work for team reference.
  * Manage backlog efficiently.
  * Proactive in research (e.g., vector DBs, new pipelines).
* **Management/Collaboration**
  * Take ownership of assigned projects.
  * Support knowledge sharing with teammates.
* **Improvement Area**
  * Communication skills—sometimes I focus too deeply on technical tasks and need to express progress and blockers more clearly to the team.
  * I’m actively working on this.

---

### **Q3. What technical skills you should improve?**

**Answer (refined):**

* **System Design** – to contribute more at the architecture level.
* **Backend Development (FastAPI, Django)** – to make myself full-stack ready for ML projects.
* **Agentic Frameworks (MCP, ADK, LangGraph, etc.)** – to keep up with the latest AI/LLM advancements.
* **Scalability & Deployment** – focusing on MLOps practices for production-grade models.

✅ **Suggestions to Pass the Meeting Smoothly**

1. **Show ownership** – emphasize how you didn’t just “do tasks” but also improved workflows (e.g., backlog, documentation, research).
2. **Balance confidence + humility** – rating yourself 9/10 is good, but make sure you highlight 1–2 weaknesses (like communication) so it doesn’t feel arrogant.
3. **Future mindset** – bosses like hearing how you’ll align with company growth. Emphasize *system design, scalability, backend skills* – these show long-term value.
4. **Be concise but clear** – don’t over-explain each project unless they ask.




### **Q1. Past year + Next year goal**

**Past year** :

* SRS → POC, LLM integration, architecture, docs
* Sevensix → RAG pipeline, DB research, POC, handover
* Ving → Requirement analysis, delivery plan
* Leather (main) → ViT pipeline, data prep, training, inference, accuracy improvement
* **Next year** :
* Improve **system design** & backend (FastAPI, Django)
* Focus on **MCP, ADK, agentic workflows**
* Better **communication & presentation**
* Be ready for **any AI/ML project**

---

### **Q2. Rating out of 10**

* **9/10**
  * Strong on deadlines, backlog, documentation, ownership
  * Improved research + delivery balance
  * Need to improve communication → aiming for 10/10

---

### **Q3. Technical skills to improve**

* **System design**
* **Backend (FastAPI, Django)**
* **Agentic frameworks (MCP, ADK, LangGraph)**
* **MLOps / deployment scalability**
